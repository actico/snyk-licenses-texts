Licensee may seek advice on the suitable License type directly from Highsoft. In such case, Highsoft will use

3.3 OEM License
Through an OEM License, Highsoft grants Licensee a non-exclusive, perpetual, non-reusable, worldwide right
to install, reproduce, use and further develop Licensed Software as an integral part of a Licensee Product,
provided that such Licensee Product be supplied to Third Party through a Customer Installation, with or without
Developer Rights and, dependent on Licensee’s choice as specified in License Statement. The right to use
the Software granted herein shall not be sublicensable except that Licensee may grant its customers the right
to install and use the Software as an integral part of a Licensee Product.
